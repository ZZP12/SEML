# Semi-English Modeling Language (SEML) Compiler

## Introduction
SEML compiler is a code generation translator that transforms English-like descriptions of biological network into modeling written in runnable programming languages, such as the [Julia](http://julialang.org), [Python](https://www.python.org) and [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

### Installation 

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ZZP12/SEML/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Usage 
To generate a model, issue the command ``make_model.jl`` from the command line (outside of the REPL):

	$ julia make_model.jl -m <path to the input file> [-o <path to output directory> -s <host type> -l <target programming language> -r <modeling framework>]

The ``make_model.jl`` command takes four command line arguments:

Argument | Required | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
-m | Yes| none | Path to input file (your \*.net or \*.dat or \*.jl file)
-o | No	| ./autogeneratedmodel | Path to where files are written
-s | No	| bacterial | Host type (bacterial \| mammalian)
-l | No | julia | programming language (julia \| python \| python2 \| python3 \| matlab)
-r | No | Kinetics| FBA or Kinetics
