## Introduction to SEML
SEML: A Simplified English Modeling Language for Constructing Biological Models in Julia
SEML compiler is a code generation translator that transforms English-like descriptions of biological network into modeling written in runnable programming languages, such as the [Julia](http://julialang.org), [Python](https://www.python.org) and [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
See our [Github webpage](https://zzp12.github.io/SEML/) 

## Requirement 

## Installation 

Within [Julia](http://http://julialang.org), use the `clone` command of the package manager to download and install the POETs repository:

```
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/ZZP12/SEML.git")
```
To use POETs in your project (following installation) simply issue the command:

```
using SEML
```
To delete the JuPOETs package use the command:

```
Pkg.rm("SEML")
```


## Usage 
To generate a model, issue the command ``make_model.jl`` from the command line (outside of the REPL):

	$ julia make_model.jl -m <path to the input file> [-o <path to output directory> -s <host type> -l <target programming language> -r <modeling framework>]

The ``make_model.jl`` command takes four command line arguments:

Argument | Required | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
-m | Yes| none | Path to input file (your \*.net or \*.dat or \*.jl file)
-o | No	| ./autogeneratedmodel | Path to where files are written
-s | No	| bacterial | Host type (bacterial \| mammalian)
-l | No | julia | programming language (julia \| python \| python2 \| python3 \| matlab)
-r | No | Kinetics| FBA \| FVA \| Kinetics
