## Introduction to SEML
SEML: A Simplified English Modeling Language for Constructing Biological Models in Julia
SEML compiler is a code generator that transforms simplified English description of biological network into modeling written in a runnable programming language, such as the [Julia](http://julialang.org), [Python](https://www.python.org) and [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
See our [Github webpage](https://zzp12.github.io/SEML.jl/) 

## Requirement 
In order to use SEML, the user needs to [install Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform.html) first. This version is compatible with [Julia v1.1.0](https://julialang.org/downloads/index.html).
The following Julia packages are required to run the demontration examples in Julia: 
* [GLPK](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/GLPK.jl)
* [ODE](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/ODE.jl)
* [PyPlot](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl) 

It can be installed by running in Julia: 

```
using Pkg
]
(v1.1) pkg> add GLPK ODE PyPlot
```


## Installation 


Within [Julia](http://http://julialang.org), use the `clone` command of the package manager to download and install the POETs repository:

```
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/ZZP12/SEML.jl.git")
```

To delete the JuPOETs package use the command:

```
]
(v1.1) pkg> rm SEML
```



## Usage 
To use POETs in your project simply issue the command:

```
using SEML
make_model(arg1[, OutPath=arg2, Host=arg3, Model=arg4, Lang=arg5])
```

The ``make_model.jl`` command takes four arguments:

Argument | Required | Description | Options | Default
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
arg1 | Yes | path to input file | | none 
OutPath | No	| path to where files are written | | ./autogeneratedmodel 
Host | No	| host type  | bacterial \| mammalian | bacterial 
Model | No | model type | FBA \| FVA \| Kinetics | Kinetics 
Lang | No | programming language | julia \| python \| python2 \| python3 \| matlab | julia 

## Output Files
